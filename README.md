### Implementing roaming user profile on Linux.

* There is a local copy of the user profile, say at `/usr/local/DOMAIN/user`, and
* There is a remote copy of the user profile, _stored on a central server and mounted on the local system_, say at `/usr/roaming/DOMAIN/user`.

The task is to keep these profiles in sync.

*P.S.*
Tested on Ubuntu 16.04.
